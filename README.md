# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

A website code refactor to clean up html and css and give it more accessibility. Refactoring code to meet a new set of standards and to make it more accessible for people with disabilities who can access the website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Also re-organized some of the HTML semantics, and cleaned up some of the CSS style-sheet by consolidating to help better preserve the code long-term.

The HTML and CSS files have visible commented documentation of the changes made in order to clean and refactor the code.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
